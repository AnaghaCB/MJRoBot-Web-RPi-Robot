# MJRoBot-Web-RPi-Robot
Those are the HTML Pages and scrips used for the Web controlled robot based on Raspberry Pi project.

The project was divided in two parts and published as Instaructables:

http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Controlling-a-Raspberry-Pi-Robot-Over-Internet/
In this instructable, we will create a fully controlled IoT Raspberry Pi Robot. The idea is to control the robot (or anything), using low level commands written with shell scripts commanded straight from the HTML page. Not using higher level languages as Python for example, makes the robot very responsive and quick to act.

In this part of the project we will learn:

a) Install and use the library WiringPi to control the RPi GPIOs
b) Control motors using a H-Bridge
c) Make the RPi a WebServer
d) Create a HTML to control the robot over internet

If you want to go further and provide your robot with "vision", you can go to the second part of this tutorial:

http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Raspberry-Pi-Video-Streamer-and-PanTilt-Camera/

There, you will learn:

a) How to stream video with a PiCam
b) How to install and use ServoBlaster library
c) How to control servo motors and build a PAM/TILT camera position mechanism
d) Create a HTML page to control the camera position over the internet
